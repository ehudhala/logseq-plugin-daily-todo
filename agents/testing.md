# Testing

The plugin has a headless end-to-end test suite that drives real
Logseq.app via Playwright with an isolated temp profile. It covers the
journal-migration logic by seeding markdown fixtures, triggering
`create-today-journal!` via file deletion, and asserting on the
resulting markdown content (file diffs, not API call counts).

## Commands

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:quick        # one mega-migration sanity case (~17s)
pnpm test:e2e              # full suite — migration + shortcuts (~3m30s)
pnpm test:e2e:shortcuts    # shortcut cases only (~1m30s)
```

### Dev loop

While iterating on `src/main.ts`, run `pnpm test:e2e:quick` after each
change. The mega-fixture exercises every migration rule in one shot
(group migration, DONE retention, title duplication, recursion,
multiple groups, separators) so a single PASS gives high signal that
nothing broadly regressed.

### Before opening a PR

Run `pnpm test:e2e` (the full suite) — 13 cases that pin down each
rule independently and surface specific failures. Two cases are
expected to be `KNOWN-FAIL` against the current plugin code:

- `rule-7-recursion-mixed-children` — when a parent has mixed
  TODO/DONE children, the DONE child is dropped instead of staying
  in source.
- `rule-11-today-has-pre-existing-content` — when today already has
  content, migration overwrites it instead of appending.

Both are real plugin bugs the test surfaced. The assertions describe
the *correct* behavior; flip the `knownFailing` flag once the plugin
is fixed and the test will turn green.

## How it works (short version)

- `e2e/run.sh` — entry script. Hard-link-clones `Logseq.app` to
  `/tmp/LogseqPatched.app`, patches `electron.js` to honor
  `LOGSEQ_FAKE_HOME` (a macOS-specific workaround — see
  [`agents/research/2026-05-09-modernization-ai-first-and-e2e.md`](./research/2026-05-09-modernization-ai-first-and-e2e.md)
  §4.2), then invokes the runner.
- `e2e/runner.mjs` — orchestrates the suite. Selects which cases run
  based on `--quick` / `--shortcuts` / no-flag.
- `e2e/harness.mjs` — launches Logseq via Playwright's
  `_electron.launch`, opens the fixture graph, waits for the plugin to
  load, and exposes per-case helpers (`runMigrationCase`,
  `runShortcutCase`, `resetGraph`, `seedJournals`, `triggerMigration`).
- `e2e/cases/migration.mjs` — the 12 rule-based migration cases.
- `e2e/cases/sanity.mjs` — the one mega-fixture case for `--quick`.
- `e2e/cases/shortcuts.mjs` — keyboard shortcut cases (some marked
  `knownFailing` due to harness-level focus issues; see file comments).
- `e2e/fixtures/test-graph/` — minimal Logseq graph: just
  `logseq/config.edn`. Journals are written at test time using real
  system dates.

## Constraints

- **macOS only.** The patch in `run.sh` is macOS-specific. Linux/Windows
  would need an equivalent isolation pattern (likely simpler — Linux
  Electron honors `HOME`).
- **Real `~/.logseq/` is never touched** by patched runs. The harness
  snapshots `~/.logseq/settings/` mtimes before/after and reports any
  drift; the runner fails non-zero if anything was touched.
- **Logseq.app must be installed at `/Applications/Logseq.app`.**

## Authoring a new migration case

Add an entry to the array in `e2e/cases/migration.mjs`:

```js
{
  name: 'descriptive-case-name',
  journals: {
    yesterday: `- TODO Some task\n`,   // pre-state
    today: '-\n',                      // pre-state (placeholder)
    // optional: '2024_01_15': `...`,  // historical journals
  },
  todayWaitMatch: c => /TODO Some task/.test(c),  // wait predicate
  expect: (j) => allOf(
    contains(j[TODAY_FILE], /TODO Some task/, 'today must have task'),
    notContains(j[YDAY_FILE], /TODO Some task/, 'yday must not retain'),
  ),
}
```

For cases where no migration should fire, set `noMigrationExpected: true`
instead of providing a `todayWaitMatch` — the harness will skip the
~15s wait and use a brief settle delay.

## Authoring a new shortcut case

Shortcut cases run against `yesterday`'s journal (Logseq's
`create-today-journal!` races on-disk seeds for today's file, so the
harness remaps any case that declares content under `today` to
`yesterday`). After each keystroke the harness sends `Escape` to commit
the edit and close the editor; without that, Logseq keeps the editor
open over the just-edited block, hiding `.block-content` for that block
and making subsequent re-focus calls miss.

```js
{
  name: 'descriptive-case-name',
  journals: { today: `- Buy groceries\n- Pay bills\n` },
  focusText: 'Buy groceries',          // substring match on .block-content
  actions: [{ press: 'Meta+1' }],      // mod = Meta on macOS
  expect: (j) => contains(j[YDAY_FILE], /^- TODO Buy groceries$/m, '...'),
}
```

Multiple presses on the same block work too — re-pass `focusText` in
each action object so the harness re-locates the block after each
keystroke (the editor closes on Escape after every press, so the block
re-renders in `.block-content`):

```js
actions: [
  { press: 'Meta+1' },                                    // → TODO
  { focusText: 'Buy groceries', press: 'Meta+1' },        // → DONE
  { focusText: 'Buy groceries', press: 'Meta+1' },        // → blank
],
```
