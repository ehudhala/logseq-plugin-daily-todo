# logseq-plugin-daily-todo

This plugin moves unfinished tasks from yesterday to every new journal and adds handy shortcuts from OneNote to Logseq:
* `cmd+1` - toggle TODO state of selected blocks between TODO/DONE/non-task block
* `cmd+4` - highlight the selected block

The skeleton and most shortcut handling is forked and updated from https://github.com/vipzhicheng/logseq-plugin-heading-level-shortcuts

Please note: this plugin is very specific to how I manage tasks in Logseq, and the code is still in an experimental but working state.
Suggestions and improvements are welcome.
